Created requirements document with minimum requirements to make a functional game. Began R&D on how to approach the user interface. There's a few low-level libraries that can do the arrow key movement, but I want to see if I can do it with native C++ Standard Library modules first. It seems [Windows.h](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-functions) has some functions that control the terminal window directly, so need to explore that. Got some initial ideas down for the Map class.
